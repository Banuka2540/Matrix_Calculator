# 🧠 NumPy Array/ Matrix Calculator

A modular, interactive NumPy-based command-line application for creating, manipulating, and visualizing arrays in 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D. Built with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib — this project is a great way to explore array operations, filtering, and data visualization hands-on.

## 🚀 Features

- 📐 Create arrays: 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D with user input  
- ➕ Perform math operations: Addition, Multiplication, Dot Product  
- 🔧 Manipulate arrays: Reshape, Flatten, Transpose, Split  
- 🔍 Slice, Index, and Filter data  
- 📊 Visualize arrays using Line, Bar, Histogram, and Pie Charts  
- 🔁 Persistent array storage for cross-module access  
- 💥 Clean error handling using try/except  
- 🧑‍💻 Perfect for learning or teaching NumPy interactively
